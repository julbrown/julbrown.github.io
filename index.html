    <p>Back in high school I took a course on HTML, but it wasn't 
        until recently that I'd really started to get interested in coding.
        I am currently working full time as a Supply Planner and taking the
        MIT xPro class on Full Stack Development part time in order to try 
        to gain a new skill that I think I will really enjoy!</p>
